## Characters rebalance
*original idea and planning by FantasyJared*

The biggest part of the rebalance mod.  
Just kindly read the changelist, please. Or look at the Encyclopedia.  
Note that most of the shared skills got quite a bit stronger.  


Thanks to **windypanda1** for implementing Azar and Johan!
