## Enemy rebalance
*original idea and planning by FantasyJared*

Increases *maxHp* of every enemy **including** bosses by 20%.  
As the rebalance mod is a somewhat player sided this change can help to keep up the challenge.  
[ExpertPlusMod](https://chrono-ark.thunderstore.io/package/TeamWindy/ExpertPlusMod/) is a good fit for the rebalance mod as well.
