## Equipment tweaks
*original idea and planning by FantasyJared*

Changes stats and behavior of equipment, relics and potions.  
Most the equipment got some sort of change. Overall, it's a bit of an improvement but nothing too wild.  
As for relics and potions only the very overpowered/underpowered items were tweaked.
